# VMRobotControl.jl

VMRobotControl allows you to build dynamic controllers for your robot as intuitive
virtual mechanisms.
You design your controller by building a virtual mechanism.
You connect the virtual mechanism to the robot through compliant elements (like springs and dampers).
The control action is automatically translated to the robot actuators (desired joint forces/torques).

This package is designed for building, simulating and controlling robots
using passivity-based controllers represented by virtual mechanisms.
This is in the tradition of *virtual model control* and *energy shaping/damping injection*.
For a defined robot geometry, you can select specific *coordinates* and connect
 *components* to shape the robot dynamic properties.
properties.
This provides a simple way to program complex robot behaviour incrementally, from mechanical 
primitives.
